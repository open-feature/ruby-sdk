This is the Ruby implementation of [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.

## Support Matrix

| Ruby Version | OS                    |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Ruby 3.1.4   | Windows, MacOS, Linux |
| Ruby 3.2.3   | Windows, MacOS, Linux |
| Ruby 3.3.0   | Windows, MacOS, Linux |

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```sh
bundle add openfeature-sdk
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```sh
gem install openfeature-sdk
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'open_feature/sdk'
require 'json' # For JSON.dump

# API Initialization and configuration

OpenFeature::SDK.configure do |config|
  # your provider of choice, which will be used as the default provider
  config.set_provider(OpenFeature::SDK::Provider::InMemoryProvider.new(
    {
      "flag1" => true,
      "flag2" => 1
    }
  ))
  # alternatively, you can bind multiple providers to different domains
  config.set_provider(OpenFeature::SDK::Provider::NoOpProvider.new, domain: "legacy_flags")
  # you can set a global evaluation context here
  config.evaluation_context = OpenFeature::SDK::EvaluationContext.new("host" => "myhost.com")
end

# Create a client
client = OpenFeature::SDK.build_client
# Create a client for a different domain, this will use the provider assigned to that domain
legacy_flag_client = OpenFeature::SDK.build_client(domain: "legacy_flags")
# Evaluation context can be set on a client as well
client_with_context = OpenFeature::SDK.build_client(
  evaluation_context: OpenFeature::SDK::EvaluationContext.new("controller_name" => "admin")
)

# fetching boolean value feature flag
bool_value = client.fetch_boolean_value(flag_key: 'boolean_flag', default_value: false)

# fetching string value feature flag
string_value = client.fetch_string_value(flag_key: 'string_flag', default_value: false)

# fetching number value feature flag
float_value = client.fetch_number_value(flag_key: 'number_value', default_value: 1.0)
integer_value = client.fetch_number_value(flag_key: 'number_value', default_value: 1)

# get an object value
object = client.fetch_object_value(flag_key: 'object_value', default_value: JSON.dump({ name: 'object'}))

# Invocation evaluation context can also be passed in during flag evaluation.
# During flag evaluation, invocation context takes precedence over client context
# which takes precedence over API (aka global) context.
bool_value = client.fetch_boolean_value(
  flag_key: 'boolean_flag',
  default_value: false,
  evaluation_context: OpenFeature::SDK::EvaluationContext.new("is_friday" => true)
)
```

### Providers

Providers are the abstraction layer between OpenFeature and different flag management systems.

The `NoOpProvider` is an example of a minimalist provider. The `InMemoryProvider` is a provider that can be initialized with flags and used to store flags in process. For complete documentation on the Provider interface, visit: https://openfeature.dev/specification/sections/providers.

In addition to the `fetch_*` methods, providers can optionally implement lifecycle methods that are invoked when the underlying provider is switched out. For example:

```ruby
class MyProvider
  def init
    # Perform any initialization steps with flag management system here
    # Return value is ignored
  end

  def shutdown
    # Perform any shutdown/reclamation steps with flag management system here
    # Return value is ignored
  end
end
```

**Note** The OpenFeature spec defines a lifecycle method called `initialize` to be called when a new provider is set. To avoid conflicting with the Ruby `initialize` method, this method should be named `init` when creating a provider.
